Purpose: Assignment 1 README FILE

To compile the file with system: make system
To compile the file with fork: make fork
To compile the file with vfork: make vfork
To compile the file with clone: make clone
To compile the file with pipe: make pipe

Note:
 directing a file with commands on separate lines leads to continuous print of tshell>
 directing a file will stop continuous prints of tshell> if it has exit
 directing c program leads to continuous prints of tshell>

 additional file with function defintions and header file provided (ie. funcDef.c , funcDef.h)

 makefile was slightly altered to account for these additional files

 reportFile contains timing for System, Fork, VFork
 timing for Clone is printed to the screen after each command is entered

 for piping, it must be the write process running first to create the file if it doesn't exist

 reportFile will start accumulating times as system, fork, vfork are run
